**History**

**Buffalo wings** came from America in **Buffalo, New York** in the year of **1964** Without the Anchor Bar and the ingenuity of its owner (she wanted to re-purpose leftover cooked wings to feed her family), many a game day, bar-hopping American would likely never know you could combine **crispy wings bathed in sweet-hot sauce**.

*Fry it for 8-12 min in **Batches**.

*Ifyou are a beginner, do dot overcrowed the pot so you can prevent it from sticking to each other.

*If you are done cooking the chicken, **let it rest** to remove the moisture and oil.
