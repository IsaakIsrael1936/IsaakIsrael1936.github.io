**History**

**Buffalo wings** came from America in **Buffalo, New York** in the year of **1964** Without the Anchor Bar and the ingenuity of its owner (she wanted to re-purpose leftover cooked wings to feed her family), many a game day, bar-hopping American would likely never know you could combine **crispy wings bathed in sweet-hot sauce**.

**Making the sauce**

*Put the Butter and margerine **at the same time**

*Let the Butter with the Hot sauce melt.

*If it is now melted, add the 4tbsp of Vinegar.

*Cook it on **low heat**

*It is ready if it's becomne **a little thick**

*You can do this the day before or whn the chicken is frying.

*The good thing about this recipe is it is very **flexible** and you can be **creative**.

**Frying the chicken**

*Put oil that can withstand high temperatures and make sure that the whole chickn can be submerged from it.

*Heat the oil up to 150 degrees celsius or if you can see it smoking then it is ready.

*Fry it for 8-12 min in **Batches**.

*Ifyou are a beginner, do dot overcrowed the pot so you can prevent it from sticking to each other.

*If you are done cooking the chicken, **let it rest** to remove the moisture and oil.

*Do not turn off the stove because we need to make the oil **more hot** for the **second fry**.

*Make sure to **remove the small particles in the oil** because if it is not remove it will **become bitter** and **stick to the chicken**.

*When the chicken have rested enough, **start to double fry** the chicken for **2-3**.

*You will know if it's done if the **oil becomes calm**.

*The **double frying** will make the chicken **more crispy** because in the second fry, all of the **moisture** and oil is **removed**.

**Last thing to do**

*Using a **bowl** add the sauce and a small batch of chicken.

***Toss** the bowl untill the sauce **fully coats** the chicken.

*Put it on a plate and add your dipping sauces in the side.

*You can add carrots and celery as vegetables or even pickled vegetables.

*You can also eat it with rice, bread, french fries, mojos, and mashed potatoes.

*Eat and serv well.
